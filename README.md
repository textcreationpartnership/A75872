#An answer to a book, titled, Quakers principles quaking: subscribed by the name of one Ralph Hale, with an epistle (so called) to the reader, subscribed with the name of one Zachariah Crofton. A principle of darkness, deceit, and confusion in Ralph Hale, and his fellow labourer in Sathans work Zachariah Crofton, is discovered by the Quakers principle, and the Quakers principle doth stand against the power of darkness, and all the false principles in the world, them to discover and lay open. The book was said to be modestly propounded by Ralph Hale, but in it I found so many lies, slanders, and false accusations, with confused, vain, and frivolous words, as many of them is not worth mentioning; yet, lest the author should boast in his mischief, I shall lay down somthing in answer to some few of them, in respect of the number of them. / A servant to the least in the houshold of faith, and the lest amonst his brethren, whose name in the flesh is William Adamson.#
